**My Portfolio**

This project was designed as an outlet to showcase my future works. My portfolio will allow possible employers, collaborators and members of the GitHub community to see the skills that I will develop throughout the remained of the BootCamp. Creating the portfolio encouraged practice of new concepts using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as taught in class. The portfolio acted as a tool to experiment with new ideas and where new ideas can be applied in the coming weeks. 

The applicatication will deploy by selecting the following link, https://ldifederico.github.io/Portfolio/.
