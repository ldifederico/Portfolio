My Portfolio

This project was designed as an outlet to showcase my future works. My portfolio will allow possible employers, collaborators and members of the GitHub community to see the skills that I will develop throughout the remained of the BootCamp. Creating the portfolio encouraged practice of new concepts using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as taught in class. The portfolio acted as a tool to experiment with new ideas and where new ideas can be applied in the coming weeks.
